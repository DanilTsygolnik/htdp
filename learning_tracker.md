I rapidly revisited pages 16-200, jotting down vital concepts and example references on paper. Here is the [result](https://t.me/DanilTsygolnik_edu_wip/8).

### Tue, 18 Jul 2023 (+5.7h; r+1.3h)

I read chapters 1-3.5 (142/981) and took [paper notes](https://t.me/DanilTsygolnik_edu_wip/7) on concepts and definitions. It doesn't feel like much, though. I recognize most of the intoduced concepts as I've encountered them while programming in other languages. To learn the principles of good programming explained in the book, it is crucial to work through teaching examples. However, there's a lot of text dedicated to explaining sample problems. It seems like the only option is to read each chapter at least twice: first, to understand the overall structure, then to quickly re-read while noting important concepts and example references. Later, these references should help create a concise summary of the book. &mdash; 3.7h

Also, as I didn't have a plan, I inefficiently spent time tinkering with some code examples after installing DrRacket IDE. &mdash; 2h
